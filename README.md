# NightSkyEngine
A fighting game engine written in Unreal Engine 5. Please note that this is incredibly early in development, and has several missing pieces and major issues. While it is not production ready, if you're interested in the engine, I recommend downloading it and trying to make a character with it. 

For usage instructions, please read the in-progress wiki.
